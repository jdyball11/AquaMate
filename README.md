# AquaMate

## Remember to 'npm i' in both AquaMate and Client directories

# Script Commands

Best to open both the AquaMate and Client directories separately in VSCode. For all front end, work out of Client. We're using Typescript. When creating functions we need to declare the type and state they are React functional components - check Home and Navbar components for reference.

## Server
From the Aquamate directory run 'nodemon' - This will update changes without having to restart server

## Front end
From the client directory run 'npm run dev'
